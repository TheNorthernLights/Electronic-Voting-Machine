# Electronic-Voting-Machine using C++

This is an EVM which asks for the post, number of candidates appearing for that post and the candidates name. 
Once these details have been filled in, the voting begins to choose the best candidate using the "unique candidate number". 
Once the votes have been entered, the admin of this voting machine enters the number "0" to access the total votes. Access is granted only if the pass phrase is correct.
